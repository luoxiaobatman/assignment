In the project, I am responsible for the topic-related services, activities-related services. I used uml tool to draw diagrams to show the structure and working-flow of requirements, then writing code to implement them. I also optimised part of the program, for example, using [......describe what you did] Besides, I refactored and refined topic-related data structure to improve code readability and overall performance.
We use Redis middleware mainly for caching to improve responsiveness of the user request. for example [......describe what you did]. Besides, we use it to implement a simple but high performance distributed lock.
Since some data is large(more than 100M raws), we use database sharding approach to reduce rows per table per database. for OLAP, we use Hbase.
We use kafka to decouple our system, and to act as a message queue to offload side effects to improve performance of the whole system. We also use it to smooth the peek curve in many activity-related business. 
I participated in frontend development, I used Reactjs framework to develop management application.
