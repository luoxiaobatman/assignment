/**
 * Constraints and assumptions
 * <p>
 * Performance vs scalability
 * If you have a performance problem, your system is slow for a single user.
 * If you have a scalability problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.
 * <p>
 * Latency vs throughput
 * Latency is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.
 * Throughput is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.
 * <p>
 * CAP
 * Consistency - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
 * Availability - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
 * Partition Tolerance - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures
